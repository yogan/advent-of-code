# Advent of Code in Python

## Usage

```sh
./run.sh               # run with input.txt as input
./run.sh FILENAME      # run with FILENAME as input
./run.sh [-s|--sample] # run with sample.txt as input
./run.sh [-t|--test]   # run unit tests
```

Use `fd | entr -cc ./run.sh [flags]` to run automatically on file changes.
