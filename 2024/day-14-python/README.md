# Advent of Code in Python

## Usage

```sh
./run.sh                    # run with input.txt as input
./run.sh FILENAME           # run with FILENAME as input
./run.sh [-s|--sample]      # run with sample.txt as input
./run.sh [-t|--test]        # run unit tests
./run.sh [-v|--visualize]   # run with input.txt and show part 2 visualization
```

Use `fd | entr -cc ./run.sh [flags]` to run automatically on file changes.
