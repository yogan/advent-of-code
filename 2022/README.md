  [Lua](day-10-lua/day10.lua) ([tests](day-10-lua/day10_spec.lua))
- [Day 11](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/11) ‚≠ê‚≠ê in
  [C#](day-11-csharp/Day11.cs) ([tests](day-11-csharp/Day11Tests.cs),

- [Day 12](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/12) ‚≠ê‚≠ê in
  [Python](day-12-python/day12.py) no tests, but quickly done
- [Day 13](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/13) ‚≠ê‚≠ê in
  [Python](day-13-python/day13.py) input data is recursive and almost valid Python syntax, so Python /w `eval`
- [Day 14](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/14) ‚≠ê‚≠ê in
  [Python](day-14-python/day14.py) with [visualization](day-14-python/README.md)
- [Day 15](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/15) ‚≠ê‚≠ê in
  [Python](day-15-python/day15.py) "Use the force, Brute!"  
  Learned about *PyPy* and *tqdm* (see [day 15 README](day-15-python/README.md)),
  both very helpful for long-running Python scripts
- [Day 16](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/16) Ô∏è‚úñÔ∏è‚úñÔ∏è
- [Day 17](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/17) ‚≠ê‚≠ê in
  [Python](day-17-python/day17.py) used some hints for the cycle detection of part 2
- [Day 18](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/18) ‚≠ê‚≠ê in
  [Python](day-18-python/day18.py) with [3D plots](day-18-python/README.md)
- [Day 19](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/19) ‚≠ê‚≠ê in
  [Python](day-19-python/day19.py) absolutely crazy, a lot of tweaking of guessed
  parameters to throw away states so that everything fits into memory
- [Day 20](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/20) ‚≠ê‚≠ê in
  [Python](day-20-python/day20.py) modulo goes brrrr
- [Day 21](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/21) ‚≠ê‚≠ê in
  [Python](day-21-python/day21.py) expression trees and brute force binary search (with a bit of luck)
- [Day 22](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/22) ‚≠ê‚úñÔ∏è in
  [Python](day-22-python/day22.py) part 1 only
- [Day 23](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/23) ‚≠ê‚≠ê in
  [Python](day-23-python/day23.py) actually quite nice and clean code (pattern matching, list/set comprehensions)
- [Day 24](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/24) ‚≠ê‚≠ê in
  [Python](day-24-python/day24.py) BFS (caching blizzard cycles == *huge* performance boost)
- [Day 25](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/25) ‚≠ê‚úñÔ∏è in
  [Haskell](day-25-haskell/day25.hs) ùù∫ last day, took the chance to increase my language count
