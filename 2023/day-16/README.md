# Advent of Code 2023 Day 16

Terminal visualization with [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html).

Start with `./sample.sh --visualize` or `./run.sh --visualize`. Field will be
trimmed to fit the terminal size (yielding different results than running on the
full input data, which has 110 lines, very likely to not fit on your terminal).
