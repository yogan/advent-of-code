# Advent of Code 2023 Day 16

Terminal visualization with [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html).

Start with `./sample.sh --visualize` or `./run.sh --visualize`.

Field will be trimmed to fit the terminal size. This means that the laser is
likely to take a different path than the one computed for the solution based on
the full input. Input data has 110 lines, your terminal probably has less than
that. Sample (10Ã—10) easily fits, but is rather boring.

## Version 2

Made laser beam shades of green, add blue background to mirrors when the laser
has hit them.
