# Advent of Code in Python

## Usage

```sh
./run.sh                # run with input.txt as input
./run.sh FILENAME       # run with FILENAME as input
./run.sh [-t|--test]    # run unit tests
./test-ci.sh            # run tests and input
```

Use `fd | entr -cc ./run.sh [flags]` to run automatically on file changes.
