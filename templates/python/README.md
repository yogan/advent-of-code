# Advent of Code Python Template

## Usage

```sh
./run.sh               # run with input.txt as input
./run.sh FILENAME      # run with FILENAME as input
./run.sh [-s|--sample] # run with sample.txt as input
./run.sh [-t|--test]   # run unit tests
```

Use `watch.sh` instead of `run.sh` to run the script on file changes.
